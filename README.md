> 📚 The most comprehensive and organized collection of notes for University of Padua (UNIPD) Computer Science Bachelor and Master Degrees, including Data Science, Cybersecurity, ICT Innovation, and more.

---

## 📖 Overview

This repository gathers high-quality, exam-oriented, and simplified notes for almost every course in the Computer Science Bachelor (*Informatica Triennale*) and Master (*Computer Science Magistrale*) programs at UNIPD.

It includes also notes from related fields such as:
- **Data Science**
- **Cybersecurity**


This collection represents years of dedicated work in synthesizing academic materials. 

While individual components reference external sources, the collection as a whole constitutes an original work in its scope, structure, and pedagogical approach. The unique value lies in its organization, clarity, and practical integration across disciplines. 

This level of quality and comprehensiveness is not available elsewhere in a single resource. Materials are freely available for educational purposes only. Commercial use or redistribution without attribution is prohibited. If you find value in these resources, please consider supporting their continued development. This is all material created by me, original in creation and concept. 

Being student notes, it's definitely feasible to have some reference coming from mixed material. But you can understand definitely why. In case, feel free to surpass such quality and create your own version of these files. There are not perfect, far from it. But they help and helped hundreds of students. While others complain, this is a fact. Simple (for real)
